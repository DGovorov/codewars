/**
 * Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild west,â€¦
 * <p>
 * a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST".
 * Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. Going to one direction and coming back the opposite
 * direction is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water,
 * it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
 * How I crossed the desert the smart way.
 * <p>
 * The directions given to the man are, for example, the following:
 * <p>
 * String[] plan = { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
 * <p>
 * You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place!
 * So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:
 * <p>
 * String[] plan = { "WEST" };
 * <p>
 * Other examples: In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and
 * coming back right away. What a waste of time! Better to do nothing. The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"],
 * now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).
 * In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become
 * directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].
 * Task
 * <p>
 * You have to write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with
 * the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).
 * <p>
 * The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South. The Clojure version
 * returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
 * Examples
 * <p>
 * dirReduc(new String[]{"NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"}) => new String[]{"WEST"}
 * dirReduc(new String[]{"NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH"}) => new String[]{}
 * <p>
 * Note
 * <p>
 * All paths can't be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST",
 * "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the
 * result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].
